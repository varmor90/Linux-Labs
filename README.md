# 🧠 Linux Labs – My DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Linux lab project — the result of over **300 hours of focused study and practice**.  
This repository documents my hands-on learning of Linux system administration and shell scripting fundamentals, completed over the past **3 months** as the first major milestone in my path to becoming a **DevOps Engineer**.

---

## 📚 Learning Resources

This project was primarily based on:

- 📘 *Linux Bible* (10th Edition) by Christopher Negus  
- 🎥 Udemy course: **"Complete Linux Training Course to Get Your Dream IT Job 2025"**

I followed both theoretical material and practical demonstrations, but all scripts and README content were written and tested entirely by me to better understand and retain the material.

## 🧱 What's in this Repository?

The content is organized into modules based on thematic areas, each with its own directory, lab scripts (`.sh`), task checklist, and notes written in my own words.

| Module | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| [`Module 1`](./module-01-installation) | Installing Linux (CentOS), VMs, ISO, setup |
| [`Module 2`](./module-02-linux-basics) | Shell basics, navigation, help commands |
| [`Module 3`](./module-03-linux-cli-tools) | CLI tools, text editors, disk usage |
| [`Module 4`](./module-04-linux-fundamentals) | Permissions, pipes, file operations |
| [`Module 5`](./module-05-system-administration) | Users, sudo, system services, monitoring |
| [`Module 6`](./module-06-shell-scripting) | Shell scripting basics, loops, conditions, backup automation |
| [`Module 7`](./module-07-networking-updates) | Networking, SSH, DNS, Apache, package management |
| [`Module 8`](./module-08-disk-management) | Boot process, partitions, RAID, LVM, NFS, Samba, LAMP |
| [`Module 9`](./module-09-troubleshooting) | Troubleshooting, hardening, SELinux, network issues |

## 📌 What's next?

This project is the foundation of my DevOps journey. I'm currently continuing with:

- 🐳 Docker & containerization
- ☸️ Kubernetes basics and production-ready deployments
- ☁️ AWS: EC2, S3, RDS, ELB, AutoScaling, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch
- 🔁 CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, and GitHub Actions
- 🛠️ Configuration management with Ansible
- 🧱 Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- 🐍 Python scripting for automation
- 🔧 GitOps workflows and cloud-native delivery strategies

All of this will lead to building and managing scalable, automated, cloud-based systems using modern DevOps practices.
